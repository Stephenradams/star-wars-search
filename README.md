# About this app

This is a demo app exploring the routing within a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app. The app is using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) to get lists of data
from the films and uses basic routing to show the details of each API request in a page.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
